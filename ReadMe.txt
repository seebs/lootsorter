This is... well, basically, I wanted to be able to type /ls.

It's also a sort of test addon for working on, designing, and debugging
LibBaggotry.  Especially the "other characters' inventories" features.

For now:
	/ls -C *
will show you everyone's inventory and bank.  Some filtering is available;
e.g.,
	/ls -c material -C *
will show all things tagged as "materials".
